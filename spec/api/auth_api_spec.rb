  # Create an access token

  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :melio_account The &#x60;Melio-Account&#x60; header is used when a Partner wants to perform an operation on behalf of one of its Accounts. It contains the Account&#39;s ID which returned when creating the Account, or when retrieving all of the Partner&#39;s Accounts. Note that most operations are not permitted without the presence of this header.
